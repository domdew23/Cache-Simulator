# Cache-Simulator
Simulates how a cache operates. Written in C.

Can be run by compiling the C code and running the program with the input.txt file as a parameter. The display will be a hit or miss for each location in memory.

The first 4 lines of the input file specify: number of sets, lines per set, block size (in bytes), number of physical (main memory) address bits.
